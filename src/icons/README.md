# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following PNG icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)  
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a consistent design across all sizes
- Include "AI" or "ðŸ””" elements to represent the extension's purpose  
- Use colors that work well on both light and dark backgrounds
- Ensure readability at the smallest size (16px)

## Suggested Design

A blue circle with "AI" text or a bell icon with AI elements would work well for the AI SUS Watcher branding.

For now, the build script will create placeholder icons. Replace these with actual PNG files for production deployment.
